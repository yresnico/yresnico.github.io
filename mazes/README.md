# mazes
JS project for 3-d maze generation and solving (note that 1 is a valid option for depth, which will produce the equivalent of a 2d maze)

Main project page: maze-widget.html

Contains a working key-controlled maze and controls for generating/saving/loading mazes, for showing the solution or a hint, and a reset button.

SearchDemo page: search-demo-test.html

Contains a working comparison of the BFS, DFS and "A*" algorithms by maze generation type/ size

The other html files are/were utilized in testing and are not really useful to anyone at this time.
